# Desk-Lamp-Alternative-Firmware
An alternative firmware for the Mijia Xiaomi Desk Lamp

After finding [fvollmers](https://github.com/fvollmer/xiomi-desk-lamp-open-firmware) project, it was possible to create this firmware. Thanks for the inspiration and the helpful details like GPIOs and pinouts.

- This alternative firmware compiles with the Arduino IDE.
- It provides a webserver and URLs for controlling the light.
- The rotary knob is WIP...
